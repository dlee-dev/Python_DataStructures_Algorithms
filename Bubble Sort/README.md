# Bubble Sorting Algorithm

**Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements.**

Big O notation:
| Cases         |  Complexity   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Best          |          O(n) |
| Worst         |   O(n^2)      |
| Average       |   O(n^2)      |
| Space         |     O(1)      |

**Best Case Time Complexity is O(n) occurs when array is already sorted**
**Worse Case Time Complexity is O(n^2)occurs when array is reverse sorted**
**Space Complexity is O(1) because it only stores one temporary value for comparison**
